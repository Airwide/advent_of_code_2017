In which I aim to post shortened solutions to as many challenges as possible.

The intent is to keep the code as short as possible, "golfed", see [Code Golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf).

The one being that, at least for the time being, all solutions will read text files, the same text files that the ordinary solutions use.

That is, a golfed solution to challenge 10a would use the text file `input_10.txt`, rather than a one character long file name, or something altogether different. This may change in an upcoming version, if there is enough time.
